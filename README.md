# ece491-uiDesign

This project is an implementation of a planner web-app my group and I designed for ourselves. The goal is for electrical engineering students at Cooper Union to use our website as well. The website keeps track of the problem sets, exams, projects, and meetings/events students encounter throughout the semester.
